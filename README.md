# Virtual Instrument



- The application is a ***virtual instrument*** that will look like a piano, which you can play using your keyboard 
(the keyboard you use to type). This application will use the second row of keys to play notes ("a" to "l"). You will 
be able to play multiple notes at once and create harmony.

- This application can be used by anyone, all you would need is a computer with a keyboard.

- I've always been interested in musical applications, and I'd like to use this opportunity to work on creating an 
interesting application that incorporates music into it.
